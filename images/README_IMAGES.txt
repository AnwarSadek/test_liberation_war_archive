Place your Photoshop-exported images in this folder using the filenames below (or update the HTML to match your names).

Recommended filenames (used by the HTML):
- army1.jpg        (thumbnail / preview)
- army2.jpg
- army3.jpg
- army4.jpg
- army5.jpg
- army6.jpg

Recommended large versions for the lightbox (replace or create):
- army1_large.jpg  (1600px wide recommended)
- army2_large.jpg
- army3_large.jpg
- army4_large.jpg
- army5_large.jpg
- army6_large.jpg

Sizing recommendations:
- Thumbnails: 800px wide and cropped to 3:2 or 4:3; file size under 250KB if possible.
- Large images: 1400–2000px wide for good display on large screens; use JPEG with quality 75–85 to balance quality and file size.

If you export from Photoshop, you can use "File → Export → Save for Web (Legacy)..." or "Export As..." to control formats and sizes.

If you'd like, I can also update the HTML to accept different filenames or add automatic srcset attributes for responsive images.
